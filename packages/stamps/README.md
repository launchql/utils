PostgreSQL extension providing trigger functions for automatically adding timestamps and user tracking to database tables. This extension simplifies the implementation of audit trails by automatically recording creation and update timestamps, as well as the users who performed these actions.

## Usage

```sql
-- Create a table with timestamp and user tracking columns
CREATE TABLE my_schema.my_table (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name text,
  created_at timestamptz,
  updated_at timestamptz,
  created_by uuid,
  updated_by uuid
);

-- Add timestamp trigger to automatically set created_at and updated_at
CREATE TRIGGER set_timestamps
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON my_schema.my_table
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE stamps.timestamps();

-- Add user tracking trigger to automatically set created_by and updated_by
CREATE TRIGGER set_peoplestamps
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON my_schema.my_table
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE stamps.peoplestamps();

-- Now when you insert or update records, the stamps are automatically set
INSERT INTO my_schema.my_table (name) VALUES ('Example');
-- created_at, updated_at, created_by, and updated_by are automatically populated

UPDATE my_schema.my_table SET name = 'Updated Example' WHERE id = 1;
-- updated_at and updated_by are automatically updated while created_at and created_by remain unchanged
```

## Features

- Automatic timestamp management with `stamps.timestamps()` trigger function
- Automatic user tracking with `stamps.peoplestamps()` trigger function
- Integration with JWT claims for current user identification
- Proper permission grants for authenticated and anonymous roles
